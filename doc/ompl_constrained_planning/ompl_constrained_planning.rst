OMPL Constrained Planning
=========================

This tutorial shows how to use OMPL's Constrained planning capabilities from MoveIt. It will be easier to follow if you have read through the tutorial on the move group C++ interface and the tutorial on OMPL planners.

The tutorial on the `Move Group Interface <../move_group_interface_tutorial/move_group_interface_tutorial.html#planning-with-path-constraints>`_ shows you how to solve a motion planning problem with path constraints. In this tutorial we will do the same with with different settings for OMPL. This have some advantages as show in the video below:
